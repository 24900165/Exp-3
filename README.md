# Exp - 3 RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To develop the Railway Reservation System using Star UML tool.
# SRS (Procedure):
1. **Problem Identification** – Identify the need to automate railway ticket booking and reservation management.
2. **Requirement Gathering** – Collect requirements from passengers, booking clerks, and administrators.
3. **System Analysis** – Study the existing manual or semi-automated process and find limitations.
4. **System Design** – Design modules for ticket booking, cancellation, train schedule, and passenger records.
5. **Functional Specification** – Define main functions like search train, book ticket, cancel ticket, and view status.
6. **Non-Functional Specification** – Specify requirements for speed, security, reliability, and ease of use.
7. **Testing & Validation** – Test each module to ensure correct booking, data accuracy, and system performance.
8. **Documentation & Maintenance** – Prepare user manuals, maintain records, and update the system when needed.
